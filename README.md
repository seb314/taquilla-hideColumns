# taquilla-hideColumns
Automatically tag mails in Thunderbird using Machine Learning/Bayes; small modification of R Kent's TaQuilla, with the custom columns hidden by default

The original TaQuilla can be found here 
* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/taquilla/ 
and here 
* http://mesquilla.net/betas/taquilla-3.4.xpi
This repo is based on the beta version, because the other one did not work with my current Thunderbird (45.7.0)
